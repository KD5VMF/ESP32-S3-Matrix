# Waveshare SP32-S3-Matrix Project Overview

Introduction
The ESP32-S3-Matrix is an advanced microcontroller board that integrates an ESP32-S3 SoC with an 8x8 RGB LED matrix, an onboard QMI8658C 6-axis IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), and a variety of peripheral interfaces. The device is designed for interactive projects, games, and real-time visualizations, making it an excellent platform for both beginners and experienced developers.

In this project, we have collaborated to develop several programs that leverage the capabilities of the ESP32-S3-Matrix. These programs demonstrate how to use the onboard IMU to control graphics on the LED matrix, providing an interactive and visually engaging experience.
